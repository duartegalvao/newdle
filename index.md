**newdle** is a tool developed by the [Indico Team](https://getindico.io/about/) @ [CERN](https://home.cern/) to **manage the process of organizing meetings**. As other commercial and Open Source solutions, newdle provides the functionality of creating ad-hoc polls to schedule meetings when everybody (or at least most of the people involved) are able to attend. How is it done? The tool provides for the creators of the polls (henceforth **newdles**) the possibility to choose different options to schedule the meeting, i.e. to choose different time slots within a day or from several days, in order to find the best options for everybody.

newdle has been created to streamline the process of choosing **the perfect date and time** for a meeting or event, avoiding the tedious and time consuming tasks that supposes organizing these meetings when is doing sending emails or private messages.

Once the newdle is done, the creator **sends the invitation to vote** to all the participants they want. Those participants will receive an email with the link of the newdle to vote and they can **choose those option(s) that fit** better for them. Once everyone has voted or the creator has closed the newdle it is **easy to choose the final date for the event**.

A few of the **most remarkable features** of this tool among others are the **user-friendly and modern interface** and the additional **freedom and flexibility**, features that come with being part of an Open Source ecosystem. Additionally, none of the other options available in the market seem to seamlessly integrate with other enterprise systems.

newdle is part of the [MALT project](https://malt.web.cern.ch/malt/).
